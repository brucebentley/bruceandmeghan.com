<h1>The Full Story...</h1>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The "official" start date to this story began on June 28, 2010. Four years <i>(1484 days to be exact...)</i> later, on the morning of July 21, 2014, Bruce proposed at sunrise in Duck, North Carolina. We had gone down to the Outer Banks on multiple occasions, and some of our best memories have started there &amp; will continue on those sandy dunes.</p>
<p>Meghan, being the avid athlete that she is, had decided she wanted to wake up early and go for a run on the beach, &amp; Bruce had surprisingly agreed to go along. They got up right around 5:00 AM, Meghan in her full-workout gear &amp; Bruce in his non-workout shorts/button down shirt <i>(one would say this seems pretty obvious something was up, but Meghan failed to put 2 + 2 together on this one...)</i>. They made their way down to the boardwalk right as the sun started to peek over the waves. It was one of the most beautiful sunrises they had both ever seen <i>(she's still completely clueless at this point...)</i>. Bruce put his back to the ocean, letting Meghan capture the entirety of the moment, got down on a knee, &amp; proposed. For those of you that know Meghan, she was of course sobbing hysterically, and yet somehow still managed to say the magic word, <b>YES!</b>.
<p>Back to the beach house they went, where her family was already aware that this was happening at some point during our week-long vacation. Like a 3 year-old, Meghan went running in the house, up the stairs, and proceeded to jump on her parents bed, waking up poor Evan who was sleeping directly upstairs. Now, on July 11, 2015, Meghan will say <i>YES!</i> one more time, as she becomes Bruce's wife.</p>
