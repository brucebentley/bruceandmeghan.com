                <p>Meghan and I met in somewhat random circumstances, in the midst of her new-hire training food class at SweetWater Tavern, during the summer of 2010. I remember seeing her sitting there next to my brother Jon, who was also going through the same class with her, and scrambling for ways to approach the table for any sort of introduction. Needless to say, my more-than-likely somewhat humorous introduction that day went pretty well, &amp; that where our story begins. The slight flirtatious gestures around the dining room during our "uncoordinatingly similar" schdule definitely helped me along the way for sure.</p>

                <p>I had wanted to get a summer job after my freshmen year at Radford University, which is how I ended up at SweetWater Tavern in the first place. Bruce was already working there as a server/bartender. My original intentions were to go back to school in the fall without a boyfriend, however, as soon as I met Bruce, I immediately fell in love with his smile &amp; charm. It certainly helped his case when I had heard through the grapevine that Bruce had already told co-workers <i>"That's the girl I am going to marry"</i>. Needless to say, we started dating shortly after on June 28, 2010 &amp; continued to date throughout my remaining years at Radford.</p>

    <h2>Are Getting Married!</h2>
    <h4>Saturday, July 11, 2015</h4>
    Bruce and Meghan met during the summer of 2010. Meghan wanted to get a summer job after her freshman year at Radford University. She got a job as a host at Sweetwater Tavern in Sterling, Virginia. Bruce was already working there as a server. And that was the beginning. Meghan didn't want to go back to college with a boyfriend, however, she couldn't resist Bruce's smile and charm. Bruce told another coworker as soon as he saw Meghan, "That's the girl I am going to marry." They decided to become official June 28, 2010. Four years later on July 21, 2014 they were engaged in Duck, North Carolina at the Outer Banks. Both Bruce and Meghan have many memories in the Outer Banks and love to come every year. Meghan wanted to wake up early and go for a run on the beach, and surprisingly Bruce said he wanted to come along. Bruce suggested that they check what time the sunrise was scheduled for and they set their alarms to run while the sun was rising. They got up early at 5:15 AM, Meghan was wearing her workout gear, and had no idea what was coming. They walked down the boardwalk and as they got to the beach the sun began to peek over the waves. It was the most beautiful sunrise they had ever seen. Bruce made a beautiful speech, got down on one knee, and proposed. Meghan, sobbing hysterically, said YES! They went back to the house to share with their family, it was the best vacation ever! Now on July 11, 2015 Meghan will become Bruce's wife, and they can't wait to celebrate this event with you!
